# Mathematical Theory of Data Assimilation with Applications --- Tutorials 

This repository is for a series of lectures given in the 
London Mathematical Society 2019 <a href="http://mpecdt.org/lms-summer-school-mathematics-of-climate-8-12-july-2019/" target="blank">Summer Research School on the Mathematics of Climate</a>.  

These lectures were developed in collaboration with Alberto Carrassi, Patrick Raanes and Marc Bocquet.  The development of these lectures benefited from the following works referenced,

 * Kalnay, Eugenia. Atmospheric modeling, data assimilation and predictability. Cambridge university press, 2003.

 * Doucet, Arnaud, Nando De Freitas, and Neil Gordon. An introduction to sequential Monte Carlo methods. Sequential Monte Carlo methods in practice. Springer, New York, NY, 2001.

 * <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ross/Documents/Var4d.html" target="blank">Ross N. Bannister. ELEMENTARY 4D-VAR.
DARC Technical Report No. 2</a>
