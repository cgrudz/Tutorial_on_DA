# Tutorial_on_DA

This repository is for a series of lectures given in the 
London Mathematical Society 2019 <a href="http://mpecdt.org/lms-summer-school-mathematics-of-climate-8-12-july-2019/">Summer Research School on the Mathematics of Climate</a>.  
These lectures were developed in collaboration with Alberto Carrassi.  The development of these lectures benefited from the following works referenced,

Kalnay, Eugenia. Atmospheric modeling, data assimilation and predictability. Cambridge university press, 2003.

Doucet, Arnaud, Nando De Freitas, and Neil Gordon. "An introduction to sequential Monte Carlo methods." Sequential Monte Carlo methods in practice. Springer, New York, NY, 2001. 3-14.
